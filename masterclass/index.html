<h1>Russia-Ukraine: 3rd world war would be nuclear,Lavrov warns</h1>
<p> War in Ukraine:March 2,2022 The White House announced on Wednesday that the U.S would enact additional sanctions on both Russia and Belarus.AP
Russian forces are continuing their attempted push through Ukraine from multiple directions, while Ukrainians, led by President Volodymr Zelenskyy, are putting up "stiff resistance," according to U.S. officials.

<br>
The attack began Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation."
</br>

<br>
Russian forces moving from neighboring Belarus toward Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, don't appear to have advanced closer to the city since coming within about 20 miles, although smaller advanced groups have been fighting gun battles with Ukrainian forces inside the capital since at least Friday.
</br>

<br>
Russia has been met by sanctions from the United States, Canada and countries throughout Europe, targeting the Russian economy as well as Putin himself.

Russia claims to have hit another TV tower in Kyiv
</br>

<br>
Russia claimed Thursday that its forces have "disabled" another television tower in Ukraine's capital.
</br>

<br>
Russian troops fired precision-guided weapons at a TV and radio center in the Lysa Hora region of Kyiv, according to Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov.
</br>

<br>
"A strike delivered by a long-range precision-guided weapon disabled a reserve TV and radio center in the Lysa Hora area in Kyiv which the Ukrainian Security Service has been using for psychological operations against Russia," Konashenkov said at a press briefing Thursday. "There are no casualties and there is no damage done to residential buildings."
</br>

<br>
There were reports of more explosions in Kyiv on Thursday morning, but Ukrainian officials have yet to confirm that a second TV tower was hit.
</br>

<br>
A Russian missile struck Kyiv's main TV tower in the heart of the capital on Tuesday.
</br>

<br>
Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that Russia is aiming to cut off a large part of Ukraine from the internet and communications.

US condemns Kremlin's 'full assault' on 'truth' in media
</br>

<br>
The U.S. State Department is condemning Moscow's attack on the media, saying the Kremlin "is engaged in a full assault on media freedom and the truth, and Moscow’s efforts to mislead and suppress the truth of the brutal invasion are intensifying."
</br>

<br>
"The people of Russia did not choose this war. Putin did," Ned Price, State Department spokesman, said in a statement. "They have a right to know about the death, suffering and destruction being inflicted by their government on the people of Ukraine. The people of Russia also have a right to know about the human costs of this senseless war to their own soldiers."
</br>

<br>
The statement comes 24 hours after the Russian government blocked the country's only two major independent news broadcasters, Dozhd TV and Radio Ekho Moskvy, accusing them of spreading "false information" about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><button style="height: 100px; width: 100px;">Read more</button>
